#Question 2
but first what is JSON?
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
importance of JSON are:	
1. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
2. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
3. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
4. JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

I prefer Json because it is easy to deserized and serelized and I can easily contruct a json output with List or array and also convert a json to an object of a class.
